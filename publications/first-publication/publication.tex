    % This is "partially" local to to the enclosing refsegment.
    % Meaning that paper cited in this bibliography will not appear in the main
    % bibliography, unless they are also cited outside this refsegment.
    % However, if option `sorting=none' is passed to biblatex, citations in
    % this bibliography will affect the citation order.
    % Long story short, do not use `\nocite{*}' but pass only the entries to
