  abstract     = {Often manually performed commissioning processes on building's sensors fail to systematically validate that all building's sensors operate correctly. This is so because manual processes are tedious and only inspect a limited number of sensors. As a result, sensors are often uncalibrated, biased or somehow faulty, impacting building's behaviour, comfort level and energy usage. We present a practical approach to automatically validate data from all building's sensors. We designed and implemented four different tests to detect out-of-range values, spikes, latency issues and non-monotonous values. Our tests are based on expert knowledge and do not need historical data. We ran the validation tests on a newly constructed building at the campus of the University of Southern Denmark. As a result we identified two types of faulty behaviours in the building's sensors: CO2 sensors reporting biased values and temperature sensors' readings exhibiting high latency. We show how automatic data validation for building sensors enhances the processes of detecting issues which could severely impact building's operations, and were otherwise going unnoticed. Thus, we emphasize the importance of performing data validation as a necessity for a correct building operation.},

We employed linear regression models, statistical models, and non-linear regression models. All models detected an anomalous strong oscillation in the temperature sensors. Readings fell outside the acceptable range and the coefficient of determination dropped. Our method showed promising results by introducing redundancy in the system, which can benefit several applications, such as fault detection and diagnostics and fault-tolerant control. Future work will be necessary to discover thresholds and set up automatic fault detection and diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {Buildings account for large part of global energy consumption. Besides energy consumed due to normal operation, a large amount of energy can be wasted due to faults in buildings subsystems. Fault detection and diagnostics techniques aim to identify faults and prevent energy waste, but are often difficult to apply in practice. Data-driven methods, in particular, require an adequate amount of fault-free training data, which is rarely available. In this paper, we propose a method for anomaly detection that exploits consensus among multiple identical components. Even if some of the components are faulty, their aggregate behaviour is overall correct, and it can be used to train a data-driven model. We test our method on variable-air-volume units in an existing building, executing two experiments grouping the components according to ventilation unit, and according to room type. The two experiments identified the same set of anomalous components, i.e., their behaviour was different from the rest of the group in both cases, and this suggests that the anomaly was not due to wrong group assignment. The proposed method shows the potential of exploiting consensus among multiple identical systems to detect anomalous ones.},

  abstract = {A major challenge facing the buildings sector is the absence of continuous commissioning and the lack of performance monitoring and evaluation leading to buildings energy performance gaps between predicted and actual measured performance. Aiming to better characterize, evaluate and bridge these gaps, the paper proposes an online building energy performance monitoring and evaluation tool ObepME, serving as a basis for fault detection and diagnostics and forming a backbone for continuous commissioning. A calibrated building dynamic energy model is developed and employed to automatically run on a daily basis and simulate the building transient performance for the previous day. The simulated energy consumption results form a baseline to which the actual collected data are compared to evaluate the dynamic energy performance gap. The OU44 University building in Denmark is considered as a case study to implement the proposed framework. A holistic energy model was developed in EnergyPlus and calibrated employing data from various building meters, collected weather conditions, generated occupancy schedules and systems operational parameters and set-points. The calibrated model was employed in the ObepME tool to automatically and continuously monitor and evaluate the OU44 building energy performance, on the level of the whole building and individual energy systems consumption, throughout the period from February to mid-March 2017. The reported dynamic energy performance gap was around -2.85\%, -3.47\% and 5.48\% for heating, total electricity and ventilation system electricity consumption. In addition, specific observations were made on a daily basis in terms of the overall electricity, heating, lighting and ventilation energy consumption as highlighted by the ObepME tool. The ObepME tool is currently running automatically as a part of the OU44 building continuous commissioning and performance evaluation aiming to identify possible discrepancies and deviations paving the way for a methodical preventive fault detection and diagnostics process on various levels in the building.},

The 8500m2 3-storey building was designed to meet the 2020 buildings energy class consuming only 42 kWh/m2, marking it at the top of energy efficient public buildings in the world. As a case study under the international research project COORDICY, the goal of OU44 is to function as a living lab building for research in energy informatics and occupancy behavior, aiming to improve the energy efficiency of public buildings, with full capability to monitor, manage and control the building operation. The building is equipped with energy efficient technologies including, ventilation units with heat recovery, LED lights, underfloor heating, PV modules, in addition to heating, lighting and electricity consumption sub-meters, and temperature, humidity, CO2, Lux and PIR sensors on the room level. Using collected data, the building performance in the first year of operation is reported in this paper, showing that the building is in agreement with the expected design numbers consuming about 41.45 kWh/m2. In addition, a modeling and simulation methodology is developed and implemented in the OU44 Building case to simulate the building energy performance. Employing a weather file updated for local conditions and a camera-based generated occupancy schedule, the preliminary building performance simulation results are presented and compared to the actual data. It was shown that the dynamic EnergyPlus model allows better prediction of the building energy performance compared to the Danish building certification tool BE10. As a living lab, the OU44 energy model developed is intended to be used for continuous monitoring and optimizing the performance on a daily basis to ensure that the building is performing as expected, forming a backbone for the fault detection and diagnostics work within the COORDICY project.},
